The goal is to visualize two algorithms for the course "Visualisierung von Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen".

My team, which consists of two members (Egemen Ulutürk and Pascal Schikora), visualized the arithmetic coding algorithm (Arithmetische Kodierung) and the optical triangulation algorithm (Optische Triangulation).

The project was developed using the animal framework (https://github.com/roessling/animal-av), which is developed by Guido Rössling.
If every dependency is added, like described in the course material, it should work with the newest animal version.
